-----------------------

Configuring a wireless LAN (WLAN) for a three-floor building in Cisco Packet Tracer involves designing a network with access points (APs) and routers to ensure seamless connectivity across all floors. Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:
1. Design Network Layout

    1.1. Devices to use:
         - Wireless routers or access points (1 per floor or more, based on coverage).
         - PCs/laptops with wireless adapters.
         - A central switch/router for internet connection.

    1.2. Placement:
       	 - Place a wireless router or access point centrally on each floor to provide maximum coverage.
         - Connect the routers/access points to a wired backbone network if required.

2. Add Devices in Cisco Packet Tracer

    2.1. Add routers and APs:
        - Go to the device list and select wireless routers or access points.
        - Place one router/AP on each floor.

    2.2. Add PCs/laptops: Add wireless-enabled PCs or laptops to each floor.

    2.3. Add a central router or switch (optional): Place a router/switch to provide internet connectivity and interconnect the wireless routers.

3. Configure Wireless Routers/Access Points

    3.1. Basic settings for each router/AP:
           - Click on the router/AP and navigate to the "GUI" tab.
           - Set the SSID (e.g., Building_WLAN).
           - Configure the Wireless Security:
           - Choose WPA2-PSK for encryption.
           - Set a strong password (e.g., secureWLAN123).
           - Assign a unique IP address to each AP in the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc.).

    3.2. Channel settings:
           - To avoid interference, assign different channels to routers/APs (e.g., Channel 1 for Floor 1, Channel 6 for Floor 2, and Channel 11 for Floor 3).

   3.3.  DHCP Configuration:
            - Enable DHCP on one router/AP to assign IPs to connected devices, or use a central router to handle DHCP for all APs.

4. Configure PCs/Laptops
        - Click on each PC/laptop.
        - Navigate to the Desktop tab → PC Wireless.
        - Select the Building_WLAN SSID and enter the WPA2 password.
        - Test connectivity by pinging other devices on the network.

5. Verify the Network

    5.1. Test Internet Access:
            - Connect one wireless router to a central router or modem for internet.
            - Ping an external device (like a cloud object or server in the simulation).
    5.2. Roaming Test:
            - Move a PC/laptop to another floor and connect to the respective AP.
            - Verify that it still maintains connectivity.

6. Optimize and Troubleshoot
        - Check signal strength on each floor and adjust router/AP positions.
        - Ensure no IP conflicts in DHCP or static IP assignments.
        - Use packet filters or ACLs for enhanced security if required.

This configuration will create a seamless wireless LAN across the three floors with reliable connectivity for all PCs. Let me know if you need assistance with any specific step!
