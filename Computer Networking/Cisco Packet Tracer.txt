Here’s a step-by-step guide to implementing a wireless LAN (WLAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer to connect PCs across the three floors of a building:
Steps to Implement WLAN in Cisco Packet Tracer

1. Open Cisco Packet Tracer

    Launch Cisco Packet Tracer and create a new workspace.

2. Layout the Building Floors

    Use the workspace to visually represent three floors:
        Use rectangles or labels to mark each floor for clarity.

3. Place the Devices

    Access Points:
        Select Access Points (APs) from the Network Devices section.
        Place one AP on each floor.
    PCs:
        Select PCs (End Devices) and place them on all three floors.

4. Add a Wireless Router

    Select a Wireless Router from the Network Devices section and place it centrally to connect the Access Points.
    Example: Use a device like Linksys Wireless Router.

5. Configure Wireless Router

    Click on the wireless router to open its configuration panel.
    Go to the GUI tab:
        Set SSID: Example: "Building_WLAN".
        Security Settings:
            Select WPA2-PSK.
            Enter a secure password (e.g., "password123").
        IP Configuration:
            Enable DHCP to assign IP addresses automatically.
    Save the configuration.

6. Configure Access Points

    Click on each access point to configure:
        Assign the same SSID ("Building_WLAN") as the router.
        Use the same security settings (WPA2-PSK, "password123").
        Set the channel for each AP (e.g., AP1: Channel 1, AP2: Channel 6, AP3: Channel 11) to avoid interference.
        Assign static IPs to each AP within the router’s network range.

7. Connect Access Points to the Router

    Use cables or wireless links:
        If using cables, connect the router to the APs via Ethernet cables.
        If using wireless links, ensure the SSID and settings match between the router and APs.

8. Configure PCs

    Click on each PC to open the configuration menu:
        Go to the Desktop tab → PC Wireless or IP Configuration.
        Connect to the SSID ("Building_WLAN").
        Enter the WPA2-PSK password.
        If DHCP is enabled, verify the PC receives an IP automatically.

9. Test Connectivity

    Use the Command Prompt on PCs:
        Ping other PCs on the network.
        Example: ping 192.168.0.2.
    Test wireless roaming:
        Move a PC to another floor and verify it connects seamlessly to the nearest AP.

10. Save the Project

    Save your work as a .pkt file for future reference.

Additional Tips

    Use Repeater Devices if needed to extend wireless range.
    Configure QoS (Quality of Service) if there are video/audio applications to prioritize traffic.
    Add network labels to ensure clarity in your design.
